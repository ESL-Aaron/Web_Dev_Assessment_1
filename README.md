This is the set of tasks required for Web Dev assessment 1, the focus was in HTML and CSS styling. I think I managed to get hold of the content, where the most difficult I found was lack of experience.
None of those languages (HTML and CSS) seemed harder then what we learnt before. So practice helped a lot. 
The more I tried to used different functions and code variations I understood more of it.
